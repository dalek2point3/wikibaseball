meyer was born in [[knoxville, tennessee]] to william and carrie meyer.  his father was born in [[baden]], [[germany]] and came to the united states at age 16 and operated a [[brewery]].  growing up, billy meyer's neighbor and classmate from grade school was madelon warters, who he eventually married.  meyer played baseball in grade school when his father bought him a catcher's glove to catch his older brother.  his hero was catcher [[johnny kling]].  meyer was a good student until high school when baseball became a primary focus, even resulting in a school suspension.  his father operated a brewery in [[smithton, pennsylvania]] for a time and the younger meyer worked there during vacation.  during [[sophomore]] year of high school, billy meyer was offered $75 per month to play catcher for a [[lakeland, florida]] team, but he was expected to inherit the brewery, so his father resisted the idea.  he went regardless, and played so well that a [[sanford, florida]] team offered him $175 per month to play for them.  he played for other florida teams and finally hit a championship-winning home run for [[gainesville, florida]].  when he returned to tennessee with $250, his father never protested against baseball again.<ref name=bbdigest1948>[http://books.google.com/books?id=_s0daaaambaj&lpg=pp1&dq=baseball%20digest%201948&pg=pa3#v=onepage&q&f=false baseball digest, 1948, by vince johnson from the ''pittsburgh post-gazette''.]</ref>	Billy_Meyer	2010
