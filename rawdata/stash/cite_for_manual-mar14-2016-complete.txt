so far pierce has been overlooked for election to thenational baseball hall of fame. his considerable credentials are comparable to many of the pitchers enshrined incooperstown. when he became eligible in 1970 thebaseball writers association of americahad elected only eight new members in 13 years with pierce being stuck in the voting behind such pitchers as early wynn bob lemon and hal newhouser (each of whom was eventually elected). in the next few years other pitching stars such as sandy koufax robin roberts warren spahn and whitey ford became eligible and likely drew votes away from pierce. pierce was dropped from the ballot after 1974. in discussing various criticisms of bbwaa voting over the yearsbaseball digesteditor john kuenster wrote in 2008 the dissenters wonder for example how the writers can elect pitchers whitey ford (236&ndash;106) jim bunning (224&ndash;184) and don drysdale (209&ndash;166) to the hall of fame while barely giving any recognition to billy pierce (211&ndash;169).,Billy_Pierce,2013,1886,0,,,,,,2008
