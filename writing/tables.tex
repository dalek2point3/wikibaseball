\emph{Note:} This table presents summary statistics for the two main data samples used in this study. Both samples track citations to Baseball Digest on Wikipedia between 2004 and 2012. In Sample A presented above, the unit of observation is a Publication-Year of Baseball Digest, i.e. all years between 1944 to 1984. For each of the 40 Publication-Years, I track total citations in every Wikipedia-Year between 2004 and 2012, for a sample size of 360 observations (40 issue-years times 9 calendar years). For Sample B, the unit of observation is an individual Wikipedia player-page for 541 notable baseball players. On each player-page, citations to Baseball Digest are tracked (irrespective of the year of publication) between 2004 and 2012, for a total of 4869 observations (541 pages times 9 calendar years). \emph{1(Out-Of-Copy)} is defined as all publication-years (Sample A) or debut-years (Sample B) before 1964. Traffic data is only available for years 2007 to 2013 and data is missing for other observations. See text for detailed data and variable descriptions.

Panel A documents the variation in the number of images added between 2008 and 2013 for out-of-copyright (debut before 1964) players and in-copyright (debut after 1964) players. The raw mean is adjusted to account for each player's differing exposure to the copyright rule.

\emph{Note:} This table provides a robustness check to log models for Table \ref{tab:traf}. Simple log versions of the models in Table \ref{tab:traf} were tried, however a lack of sufficient ``pre'' data (before 2008) means that the main coefficients were imprecisely estimated, and were not significant at conventional levels. As an alternative, the following table estimates cross sectional regressions that utilize the variance in \emph{copyright exposure} to estimate log models. For each player, \emph{copyright exposure} is defined as amount of their career that they played in the out-of-copyright period, i.e. before 1964. For players who retired before 1964, this index is set to one, for players who made their debuts after 1964 this index is set to zero, while for other players it is calculated as $\frac{1964 - DebutYear}{FinalYear - DebutYear}$. Because player debut and retirement years are unlikely to be related to the 1964 copyright cutoff date, this variation provides an additional source of quasi-random variation that can then be used in the cross-section to estimate the impact of copyright on internet traffic, and that helps alleviate the problem of missing traffic data for years before 2007. Columns (1) and (2) show the impact of the Copyright Exposure variable on Images, while Columns (3) and (4) estimate the effect for traffic. Coefficients are roughly the same order of magnitude as with the difference-in-difference specifications. 

Page-year level observations. Sample includes all baseball pages in 2012. The specification is $Y_i = \alpha + \beta \times out-of-copy index + \epsilon_i$. All estimates are from ordinary-least-squares (OLS) models, and columns (2) and (4) use $Log(1+Y)$ as the dependent variable.

%%\emph{Out-of-copy Exposure} is 0 for all players who made debuts in or after 1964, 1 for all players who retired before 1964 and $\frac{1964-Debut}{Career Length}$ for all other players.

All models include calendar year fixed effects. Columns (1) and (2) estimate OLS models, with column (2) also including player-page level fixed effects. Column (3) estimates Log-OLS models (i.e. the dependent variable is Log(Y+1)) with player-page and calendar-year fixed effects. See text for detailed data and variable descriptions.

%% Legal opinion about copyright law concerning periodicals (under the Copyright Act of 1909) from University of Pennsylvania Libraries is reproduced below for reference. See \url{http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/cce/firstperiod.html} for more details.

%% \begin{quotation}
%% For works that received their copyright before 1978, a renewal had to be filed in the work's 28th year with the Library of Congress Copyright Office for its term of protection to be extended. The need for renewal was eliminated by the Copyright Renewal Act of 1992, but works that had already entered the public domain by non-renewal did not regain copyright protection. Therefore, works published before 1964 that were not renewed are in the public domain. With rare exception (such as very old works first published after 2002) no additional copyrights will expire (thus entering the public domain) until at least 2019 due to changes in the applicable laws.

%% \subsection{Appendix A2 : Back-of-the-Envelope Welfare Calculation}
%% \label{sec:envelope}

%% This section outlines the methodology through which I arrive at my estimate of about \$372,920 annually for a lower bound on the loss to social welfare from copyright.

%% In order to arrive at this estimate two pieces of data are needed: (a) the approximate value of a page-view to society and (b) estimated page-views lost due to copyright. For piece (a) I used \url{webindetail.com} which provides the estimated daily earnings of Wikipedia from potential advertising which would equal to \$2.2 million dollars daily for about 400 million daily page-views.\footnote{While Wikipedia does not accept advertising, \url{webindetail.com} arrives at this estimate based on a comparables analysis based on other similar websites with a comparable user base.} This translates into a value to Wikipedia of about \$0.0055 per page-view from advertising. For piece (b) results from this study suggest that for every missing image, a Wikipedia page receives about 88 fewer page-views per month (Table \ref{tab:ivreg}) and that pages have 0.315 fewer images on average (Table \ref{tab:ddd}) due to copyright. Therefore, a page affected by copyright is expected to lose about \$0.152 per month. For the set of 335 pages affected by copyright in this study. This translates into an annual loss of about \$612 or a net present value of about \$30,600.\footnote{discounted at a rate of 2\% per year over a perpetual life term} Assuming that about 5\% of all 4.1 million articles on Wikipedia are affected in a similar way, this translates into an annual loss of about \$372,920 or a net present value of about \$18.69 million. These estimates are economically significant for Wikipedia in the light of estimates of the economic value of Wikipedia itself which is about \$43.5 million per year \citep{greenstein_technology:_2013}. Further, these estimates represent only a lower bound on lost surplus because advertising rates capture only the valuation advertisers place on readers and do not calculate value to readers including value of derivative works of Wikipedia pages.
