\emph{Note:} This table presents summary statistics for the two main data samples used in this study. Both samples track citations to Baseball Digest on Wikipedia between 2004 and 2012. In Sample A presented above, the unit of observation is a Publication-Year of Baseball Digest, i.e. all years between 1944 to 1984. For each of the 40 Publication-Years, I track total citations in every Wikipedia-Year between 2004 and 2012, for a sample size of 360 observations (40 issue-years times 9 calendar years). For Sample B, the unit of observation is an individual Wikipedia player-page for 541 notable baseball players. On each player-page, citations to Baseball Digest are tracked (irrespective of the year of publication) between 2004 and 2012, for a total of 4869 observations (541 pages times 9 calendar years). \emph{1(Out-Of-Copy)} is defined as all publication-years (Sample A) or debut-years (Sample B) before 1964. Traffic data is only available for years 2007 to 2013 and data is missing for other observations. See text for detailed data and variable descriptions.

\vspace{5mm}

\emph{Note:} This table provides a robustness check to log models for Table \ref{tab:traf}. Simple log versions of the models in Table \ref{tab:traf} were tried, however a lack of sufficient ``pre'' data (before 2008) means that the main coefficients were imprecisely estimated, and were not significant at conventional levels. As an alternative, the following table estimates cross sectional regressions that utilize the variance in \emph{copyright exposure} to estimate log models. For each player, \emph{copyright exposure} is defined as amount of their career that they played in the out-of-copyright period, i.e. before 1964. For players who retired before 1964, this index is set to one, for players who made their debuts after 1964 this index is set to zero, while for other players it is calculated as $\frac{1964 - DebutYear}{FinalYear - DebutYear}$. Because player debut and retirement years are unlikely to be related to the 1964 copyright cutoff date, this variation provides an additional source of quasi-random variation that can then be used in the cross-section to estimate the impact of copyright on internet traffic, and that helps alleviate the problem of missing traffic data for years before 2007. Columns (1) and (2) show the impact of the Copyright Exposure variable on Images, while Columns (3) and (4) estimate the effect for traffic. Coefficients are roughly the same order of magnitude as with the difference-in-difference specifications. 

Page-year level observations. Sample includes all baseball pages in 2012. The specification is $Y_i = \alpha + \beta \times out-of-copy index + \epsilon_i$. All estimates are from ordinary-least-squares (OLS) models, and columns (2) and (4) use $Log(1+Y)$ as the dependent variable.

%%\emph{Out-of-copy Exposure} is 0 for all players who made debuts in or after 1964, 1 for all players who retired before 1964 and $\frac{1964-Debut}{Career Length}$ for all other players.
